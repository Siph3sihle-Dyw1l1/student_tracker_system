💰 Student Expense Tracker System

Project Overview

The Student Expense Tracker System is a desktop application developed in Java using the Swing library, primarily built within the Apache NetBeans IDE. This project was developed as a core academic assignment at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) to demonstrate proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, data input validation, calculation logic, and file persistence.

The application allows students to input their monthly allowance and track up to three key expenses, providing a clear summary and calculating the remaining balance.
